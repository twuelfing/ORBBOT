## ORBBOT

This project was started as an experiment to see how quickly a useful radiometric sphere for use as a 3D lighting source could be captured.
the initial work was done as a collaboration with my employer, IKEA. IKEA retains no rights to this design, code, or application of the technology we have put together. 

the contributers to this project thus far have been:
* Olexander Gorbunov - writing software, schematic design, general tehncial consultation
* Troy Wuelfing - mechanical design, PCB design, fabrication, testing, funding
* IKEA Communications - funding
* Bao Huynh - logo design

It is our desire that this design will be freely used by anyone who thinks its useful
it is our dream that others will contriubute and improve on what we have made.
